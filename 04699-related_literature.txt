National rates of homicide victimization against AI&AN women are second to
those of their African-American counterparts, but higher than those for
White women; however, these national averages hide the extremely high rates
of murder of AI&AN women in some counties composed primarily of tribal
lands. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) shows that rates of
rape and other sexual assault are higher for AI&AN women compared to both
African-American and White women. National annual incidence rates and
lifetime prevalence rates for physical assaults are also higher for AI&AN
women compared to other women. As is the case with other women, AI&AN women
are more likely to be assaulted by offenders known to them than strangers.
The unique status of AI&AN tribes as both sovereign and dependent creates
problematic jurisdictional barriers that sometimes obstruct an effective
criminal justice response to AI&AN victims of violence. Other factors that
impede an effective law enforcement response to crimes on many tribal lands
are insufficient funding, inadequate police training, and victimâ
mistrust of outside authority. This report offers several recommendations
intended to provide more effective investments in combating violence
against AI&AN women. These pertain to the obtaining of valid and reliable
data on violence against AI&AN women, the development of prevention and
intervention programs for these women, and scientifically rigorous
evaluations of such programs. 17 tables, 174 references, and appended
methodological details of studies conducted at the local level

The socio-demographic factors examined included race/ethnicity; age; type
of place (urban, suburban, and rural); socioeconomic status; marital status
for adults; and family status. Overall, there was substantial variation in
the trends identified. Among the 135 trends lines generated, the findings
on race and ethnicity offer many potentially fruitful avenues for future
research. Data for female and male nonlethal violent victimization rates
for Hispanic, Black, and White females and males were relatively stable
during the 1970s and 1980s, with some minor increases and decreases. For
both females and males, the rates for all three race/ethnicity groups
reached a series high between 1992 and 1994, followed by a dramatic decline
during the late 1990s, reaching a three-decade low in the early years of
the 21st century. Moreover, the figures for both females and males show
that combining race data across ethnicity masks potentially important
differences. The patterns of victimization for Latino females and males
were more similar to those of non-Latino Blacks than to non-Latino Whites,
up until the crime peak in the early 1990s. After this, the Latino rates
become closer to those for non-Latino Whites, particularly among females.
The study also notes another important aspect of gendered victimization,
i.e., the difference across women and men in relationships between victims
and offenders. Broadly, data for 1980 through 2005 show that for both
females and males, stranger violence occurred at higher rates than other
forms of violence from 1980 through the early 1990s. This research produced
previously unknown trends by pooling and appropriately weighting the only
source of data capable of providing reliable national trend estimates,
i.e., the National Crime Survey and its successor, the National Crime
Victimization Survey.

Presents trends in the rate of completed or attempted rape or sexual
assault against females from 1995 to 2010. The report examines demographic
characteristics of female victims of sexual violence and characteristics of
the offender and incident, including victim-offender relationship, whether
the offender had a weapon, and the location of the victimization. The
report also examines changes over time in the percentages of female victims
of sexual violence who suffered an injury and received formal medical
treatment, reported the victimization to the police, and received
assistance from a victim service provider. Data are from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on nonfatal crimes,
reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.

Presents 2010 estimates of rates and levels of criminal victimization in
the U.S., including violent victimization (rape or sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, and simple assault), property victimization (burglary,
motor vehicle theft, and property theft), and personal theft (pocket
picking and purse snatching). It describes the annual change from 2009 and
analyzes long-term trends from 1993 through 2010. The bulletin includes
estimates of series victimizations (six or more similar incidents that the
victim is unable to recall individually or describe in detail), injury in
violent victimization, violence perpetrated by strangers, and the use of
firearms and other weapons in violent victimization. It also describes the
characteristics of victims. During 2010, 40,974 households and 73,283
individuals were interviewed twice for the NCVS.
